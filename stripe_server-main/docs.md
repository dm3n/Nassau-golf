# Introduction

This code sets up an Express web server that handles Stripe payments. The server listens on port 3336 and exposes a single endpoint at /api/payment_stripe. When a POST request is made to this endpoint, the server creates a Stripe checkout session and returns it to the client.

# Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies, which can be installed using npm or yarn:

express is a web framework for Node.js.
cors is a middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the server.
dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
stripe is a library that provides an API for interacting with Stripe.
Environment Variables
The code uses the dotenv module to load environment variables from a .env file. The following variables should be defined in the file:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: The secret key for the Stripe account.

1. title: The title of the item.
2. quantity: The quantity of the item.
3. price: The price of the item in CAD.
4. onSale: An optional object that represents the item's sale price. If the item is not on sale, this property should be omitted. The onSale object should have the following properties:
5. salePrice: The sale price of the item in CAD.
6. freeProduct: An optional object that represents a free product that comes with the item. If the item does not come with a free product, this property should be omitted. The freeProduct object should have the following properties:
7. title: The title of the free product.
   quantity: The quantity of the free product.
8. image: An array of objects that represent the images of the free product. Each image object should have the following properties:
9. asset.\_ref: The reference to the image asset.
   When a POST request is made to the endpoint, the server creates a Stripe checkout session based on the items in the payload. If there are any free products in the payload, the server adds a free product line item to the checkout session.
